# Code Checking Assisting Tool

Given a list of students' GitHub users and repository names, a list of .c files with inputs and expected outputs, this tool automates the process of cloning the repositories, compiling the files and running them with the given inputs.
The user proceeds to check the answers against the expected output, getting a report at the end with the results.
The students weren't given a expected format for the output, so the output validation must be done manually.
